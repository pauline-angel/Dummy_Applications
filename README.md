# Dummy_Applications<br>
I designed some dummy applications using Flask in Visual Studio Code. These can only run on local host. The main reason for designing these applications is to perform the vulnerability assessment automation tests that I have developed. (Check my other repositories for the same).<br>
<br>**Note:** Kindly **DO NOT** use these to host as production applications as these are vulnerable and are **ONLY** meant for testing.
